# COMP1950-Final-Project

This is the final project for COMP1950 at BCIT. 

The team members for this project were:
* Dan Wilcox
* James Nicolson
* Matheus Miranda
* Tracy Lam

The goal of this project was to provide a protosite (mockup) of a redesign for the COMP 1950 website (http://bcitcomp.ca/1950/). Also included in the project were the rationale behind the protosite, as well as biographies of each of the team members.

My next goals for this prototype site (post-COMP1950) are to host it and to ensure that the protosite has a more well-formed SEO.
